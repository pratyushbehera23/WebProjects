        <h1>A complete guide to becoming a self-taught programmer from beginner to developer.</h1>
        <p>Today, most engineering graduates are housed in software companies. Most software companies hire many developers every year. Even if you are from a non-computer science branch, you will most likely work for a software company.If you are a student and you have some kind of knowledge about work situations in the world and you have the intuition that your chances of working for a software company are very high. I will strongly recommend that you try at least one job at a better product based company.</p>
        <p>Don't try to access all these service-based jobs. These service-based jobs won't pay you much and 3-4 years after entering these jobs, whether you're trying to get an MBA or trying to get into a product-based company that pays better.</p>

        <h2>How can this guide be helpful for any programmer.</h2>
        <p>You will fall in any of the three category which is mentioned below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you already know how to write code in any language and want to become a software developer, you can start with Month-2 directly by skipping Month-1.</li>
            <li>If you come from a non-computer science environment and want to enter a product-based company, but don't know how to code, you should follow this guide.</li>
            <li>If you are a software developer with a degree in computer science, then you could share this knowledge with people who want to join companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, but who do not come from computer science.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have divided this guide into different months. Follow the entire procedure and I have also linked the resources where you can find all the learning material. This comprehensive guide will last one year.</p>

        <h3>Month 1</h3>
        <p>In the first month you should start learning a programming language. Learn either Python / C++. <br> I should ask you to start preferably with C++. I'm telling you to study C++ because it will be useful on your programming journey ahead. <br> Resources for learning C++ — thenewboston Youtube Channel <br> Resources for learning Python — Python tutorial by freeCodeCamp <br> In this month you should focus on the basics of any language you choose. <br> Along with completing C++ / Python lectures. You should focus on solving some basic problems in hackerrank.</p>

        <h3>Month 2, 3</h3>
        <p>You should start learning about Data Structure and Algorithms. <br> Data structure and algorithms are very important to any CS / IT job because their concepts will be verified once you start interviewing any Product-based company. <br> YouTube video link through which anyone could learn about the data structure and algorithms. — MIT OpenCourseWare <br> Don't finish watching all the videos at once. Begin practicing questions on the topic on which you have completed lectures simultaneously. Do not practice more than 7-8 questions on a topic at this time. <br> In this way, you will begin to acquire problem solving skills from questions about data structure and algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Month 4, 5</h3>
        <p>Start practicing more questions about data structures and algorithms. All programmers require problem solving skills. <br> These three months will be very important to develop your problem solving skills. Remember that. <br> Now a question arises where we must practice questions about Data Structure and Algorithms. <br> You can start practicing algorithms and data structure problems while participating in a live coding contest. <br> Two major websites hosting programming challenges include Codechef and another is Codeforces <br> Once you start practicing problems, you will learn many hidden skills that include. <br> Learn about the different types of complexity, which is the complexity of time and space. Debugging the code. How to write code under pressure, which is a very important skill.</p>
        
        <h3>Month 8, 9</h3>
        <p>Since you are from a not from computer science background, you need some skills to display on your resume.Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP. <br> As a developer, you are always expected to know all of these skills. Once you have completed learning all of these skills, try following any of the options listed below.</p>
        <p>Option 1 : Path to become a Front End developer. <br> Learn JavaScript in good measure. It will be very important in your journey as a frontend developer. Now is the time to choose a frontend framework that includes ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS. You can choose any of the three, but it seems like there are currently more developer jobs in ReactJS. For learning ReactJS use this free youtube tutorial — Learn React JS — Full Course for Beginners Start learning the framework and try building some projects. These projects will play an important role in separating you from a crowd that will apply for the job in the near future but has not built a project. </p>
        <p>Option 2 : Path to become a Backend developer. <br> For this, you can choose Django or NodeJs to become a back-end developer. For Django you need to learn Python. NodeJs is also used in backend and is quite popular these days. Once excellent resource for learning Django — Django Girls Tutorial In this website, everything is mentioned in detail if you want to learn Django. Using this website you will be able to create your own blog and also how to host a website online. If you know the basics of Javascript then you can learn NodeJS. NodeJS is an excellent backend framework to learn. In last few year demand for NodeJs developer has increased a lot. So learning NodeJS can be game changer in your career. Once you have finished either one, among Django and NodeJS. Try to create some projects using either of these two. Put these codes on github. If you can host any of your projects online, please do so. It will also give you an advantage.There are several companies out there. They request for hosted projects. Many companies like to see if you are able to host a website.For hosting purposes, you can use Pythonanywhere or any other hosting medium. </p>
        <p>Option-3 : Path to become an Android developer. <br> The journey to becoming an Android developer is not going to be that easy. As always you must maintain a learning attitude. To learn Android you have to learn any of the languages between Java or Kotlin. If you are starting your journey with Android, I suggest you start with Java first and then switch to kotlin once you have practiced creating some of the applications in Java. You must first learn the basics of Java. Next, you'll need to learn all the concepts of object-oriented programming in Java. Start with the basics of Android development like buttons, layout, etc. Create projects once you complete the basics and put all the code online on github so you can show it to potential companies. I cannot express the feeling in words that you will get once you see your application on your phone. I wrote an article on How do I get started with Android app development with just a very basic understanding about programming?</p>

        <p>Also, throughout this period, you should keep practicing questions on data structure and algorithms. <br> Do not stop participating in contests. Keep Coding.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If you followed as stated in the guide, you will definitely get a developer job at a good product based company. <br> One more thing I want to tell you. As a developer you will always have errors with your code, so debugging will be a very important part of your programming journey. Most of the time you will spend as a developer is debugging your code instead of writing a new piece of code, so learn how to debug correctly. Always remember that debugging will be the best tool with which to solve a bigger problem.</p>

        <h2>Personal tip</h2>
        <p>Helping others and asking for help should be your motto as a developer. As a developer, asking for help is also a great way to make friends.</p>
